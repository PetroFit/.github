Welcome to the PetroFit Project
===============================

The PetroFit Project is an open-source effort to provide end-to-end tools for making accurate photometric measurements,
estimating morphological properties, and fitting 2D models to galaxy images. The goal of the
`PetroFit  <https://github.com/PetroFit/petrofit>`_ Python package,
which is based on  `Astropy  <https://www.astropy.org>`_  and
`Photutils  <https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, is to provide such tools for the astronomical community.
